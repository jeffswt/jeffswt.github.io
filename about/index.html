        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Around June 2016, I created my site and utilized it as a personal blog. Throughout the years it had gradually evolved into what you are seeing right now. The site itself had undergone a few refurbishments, which changed its appearence profoundly.</p>
        <p>During the time I participated in <strong>Olympiad in Informatics</strong>, I gained a certain fetish for Splay Trees, given its ease of demonstration and powerful functions over other data structures. Most of the time it yielded incorrect answers, so I gave myself a name <strong>JeffSplayWithTrees</strong>, also abbreviated as <strong>jeffswt</strong>.</p>
        <p>So I spent 5 yearsâ€™ time learning and training in the expertise of OI, from Junior high through Senior high. These 5 years had been the most fulfilled days by then, when I attended <strong>HS Affiliated to Renmin University, China</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Tsienyi Lawyer</strong> had been our coach all those days, to whom I shall dedicate sincere gratitude, whom had always been a professional teacher.</p>
        <p>I left OI in June 2017, around 1 year after the birth of this site, but my life on Computer Science shall continue, and shall thrive for the longer.</p>
